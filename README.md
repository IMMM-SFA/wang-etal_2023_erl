## Abstract
The sensitivity of urban canopy air temperature (*T<sub>a</sub>*) to anthropogenic heat flux (*Q<sub>AH</sub>*) is known to vary with space and time, but the key factors controlling such spatiotemporal variabilities remain elusive. In this study, we develop a forcing-feedback framework based on the energy budget of air within the urban canopy layer and apply it to diagnosing ∆*T<sub>a</sub>*/∆*Q<sub>AH</sub>* simulated by the Community Land Model Urban (CLMU), where ∆ represents a change. Besides the direct effect of *Q<sub>AH</sub>* on *T<sub>a</sub>*, there are important feedbacks through changes in the surface temperature, the atmosphere-canopy air heat conductance (*c<sub>a</sub>*), and the surface-canopy air heat conductance. In summer, the positive and negative feedbacks nearly cancel each other and ∆*T<sub>a</sub>*/∆*Q<sub>AH</sub>* is mostly controlled by the direct effect. In winter, however, ∆*T<sub>a</sub>*/∆*Q<sub>AH</sub>* is enhanced due to the weakened negative feedback. The spatiotemporal variability of ∆*T<sub>a</sub>*/∆*Q<sub>AH</sub>* and the nonlinear response of ∆*T<sub>a</sub>* to ∆*Q<sub>AH</sub>* are strongly related to the variability of *c<sub>a</sub>*, highlighting the importance of correctly parameterizing convective heat transfer in urban canopy models.
